# Masters-Thesis
My masters thesis for QMSS at Columbia University
 
For my thesis I investigated the causal relationship between stock sentiment, as found in financial tweets and financial articles, and stock volatility. Using a [tidytext](https://www.tidytextmining.com/) approach, I cleaned and preprocessed the text (tweets & articles) and then tokenized the text into uni-grams for sentiment analysis. Sentiment scoring was down using two different lexicons. The [Bing](https://www.cs.uic.edu/~liub/FBS/sentiment-analysis.html) lexicon categorizes words (uni-grams) into a binary class (either positive or negative). It is suited more for general purpose sentiment analysis. The [loughran](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1540-6261.2010.01625.x) lexicon on the other hand is more appropriate for financial texts and categorizes words into six categories ("positive", "negative", "litigious", "uncertain", "constraining", "superfluous"). For my own analysis I binarized the categories from loughran into either positive or negative to make the analysis simple. Stock prices were collected for a number of different companies across different industries. This was done to see if certain industries are more receptive to market sentiment as expressed online. For modelling the relationship between sentiment and price I used a bayesian framework. This was done in order to better incorporate uncertainty into the model coefficients. I ran regression models using [Stan](https://mc-stan.org/) in [R](https://www.r-project.org/).
